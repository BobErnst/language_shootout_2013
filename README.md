##2013 Language Shootout##
======================

On June 6, we will hold the second Lambda Lounge Language Shootout. On the night of the meeting, participants will be 
given roughly 10 minutes to present any novel findings discovered in their solution to one of 4 possible programming
challenges.  Implementations can be in any language or tech stack.

###The Challenges###
The four challenges are:

  * [Counting DNA Nucleotides](http://rosalind.info/problems/dna/)
  * [Rabbits & Recurrent Relations](http://rosalind.info/problems/fib/)
  * [Mendelâ€™s First Law](http://rosalind.info/problems/iprb/)
  * [WAV file format reader/player](https://ccrma.stanford.edu/courses/422/projects/WaveFormat/)

###Sharing your work###
Participants are encouraged to pick one of the challenge problems, fork this git repo and add their implementation, 
then send a pull request to get their work added to this repository.  Participants should add their work under a directory
with their proper name (using underscores as separators instead of spaces) or their github account identity.


###Sponsor###
The food (and gifts) sponsor for this meeting is [Rackspace](http://www.rackspace.com/).
