Solutions to http://rosalind.info/problems/fib/:

  F_1 = 1
  F_2 = 1
  F_n = F_(n-1) + k F_(n - 2), n = 3, 4, 5, ...

Find F_n for n <=40 and k <= 5.

Three solutions are provided in the Racket programming language:

  naive.rkt (exponential time)
  iterative.rkt (linear time)
  binet.rkt (constant time)

The constant time Binet solution depends on the closed form
mathematical solution of the recurrance equation:

  F_n = (beta^n - alpha^n) / (beta - alpha)

where alpha and beta are the roots of the quadratic equation

  x^2 - x - k = 0.
